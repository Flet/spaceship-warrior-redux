A refresh of the spaceshipwarrior artemis project using the [libgdx maven archetype](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Maven-integration) and [junkdog/artemis-odb.](https://github.com/junkdog/artemis-odb)

Give it a try here: http://flet.github.io/spaceship-warrior-redux/



Note: the assest directory is a bit special. Its a maven module itself that will automatically pack all the graphics in the `images` directory into `images-packed\pack.atlas` for every maven build.
